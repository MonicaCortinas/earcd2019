- 2017 Global online retailing: 24.8% <i class="fas fa-arrow-up"></i> and 10.2% <i class="fas fa-chart-pie"></i> total retail sales worldwide.

- **User Experience** (UX) in e-commerce sites is increasingly important.

- **Attention** is both **pre-requirement** for response and an important antecedent of the global UX.

- Consumers' attention is **scarce resource** and the design of the web site should ease attentional processes.

- **Main objective**: understanding **user attention processes** in e-commerce websites.

# Text vs Image

## Advertising literature: 

- **Illustrations** are **key elements** to capture attention regardless of their size.

- Perception of **image** is **faster** and more **automatic**.

- **Focal attention** and willingness is required for **text processing**.

## Attention to the website literature:

- **Research** on text-image combination in the product area **is reduced**.

- Product image is a **proxy** to the product itself.

- Price and brand are even more important as there is a **lack of information about other attributes**.

- Relative importance may depend on the **stage of the purchase process** and other **top-down factors** (product involvement, relative importance of each attribute...).

# Objectives

**1**.	Analyze the **effect of the stimulus**: Is the same attention paid to the image, the price and the brand?

**2**.	Analyze the effect of the **consumers goals**: Does the attention vary when the task is different?

**3**. Analyze the effect of the **website**: Does the attention vary when the category of the product is different?

**4**.	Analyze the relationships between **observed attention processes** and **stated responses**.
